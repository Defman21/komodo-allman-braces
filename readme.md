Smart braces for Komodo 9 (experimental)
===

Auto completes curly braces to start on a new line. Created a long time ago by @Naatan, tweaked by me.

New features:

 * Macro will work only in specific file types (CSS, PHP, JS, etc., it's configurable, see line #25)
 * Macro will work only if the line passed some rules (only in specific file types: JS, PHP, etc.,
 see line #30 for the list of specific file types and line #41 for list of keywords)
